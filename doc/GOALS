OcherBook is an open-source ebook reader, supporting multiple file formats and
output devices.  It focuses on creating a good (and portable) ebook reading
experience, but not necessarily the complete software stack.  For example, for
expediency it may reuse the existing kernel on ereaders.


Technology is hard to push back against.  Books are/will be moving to
electronic.  But what problems does that pose?
    - privacy
    - control
    - accessibility
    - reliability

How does OcherBook handle these issues?

Privacy:
    - All local, no cloud
    - Open source
    - No tracking / cloud / FB integration / etc
    - Encryption
        - of personal reading record / notes
        - ...

Control:
    - All local, no cloud
    - no DRM
    - Ability to import / export your reading record / notes / etc

Accessibility:
    - All local, no cloud
    - multiple architectures
    - multiple output devices
    - low resource requirements / low power
    - support new and old tech

Reliability:
    - books do not crash or hang


How do we enjoy e-books without creating a new dark age?  (Consider DRM,
technological obsolescence, peak oil, ...)
    - discourage DRM
    - support low power (Raspberry Pi?)
    - support old tech
    - archiving is still the user's problem...
        - or is there a server side?
