During development, OcherBook might be broken (incluing the boot menu), and you need to fall back to
the stock firmware to easily recover control.

To prevent OcherBoot startup, create a file `.ocher/kill` in the root of any of the "libraries" that
OcherBook examines on startup.  In practice, this means create such a file on the SD card and insert
it before rebooting.
